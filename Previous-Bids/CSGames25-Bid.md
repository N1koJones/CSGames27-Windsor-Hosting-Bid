# Computer labs - How many available labs do you have? What's the infrastructure in place? Who is your point of contact for the school's
We have a total of 19 labs available. The Computer and Software Engineering Department manages 7 labs, each equipped with 27 computers (https://www.polymtl.ca/gigl/ressources-informatiques). Two of theses labs are equipped with decent gpu which would make them interesting for AI competition. Additionally, the school manages 12 institutional labs, each with 30 computers (https://www.polymtl.ca/si/laboratoires-denseignement-et-salles-de-cours-multimedias/laboratoires-institutionnels-denseignement#disponibilite-du-service).

We have direct contact at the school and the Computer and Software Engineering Department to access the lab and make custom images for the computers.

# Main hall - This is where the main event would take place and where you will welcome all your attending teams. Describe your selected place and it's general setup, its capacity (number of teams), the provided services (i.e. WiFi), its accessibility, where the participants would eat, etc.? Can you accomodate for multiple power bars for each teams?

The cafeteria of the pavilion principal (Rotonde) will serve as the main event venue, providing a spacious and flexible setup to accommodate easily 30 teams comfortably (the capacity). Each team will have a dedicated workspace with access to multiple power bars, ensuring all devices remain charged. High-speed WiFi will be available throughout the venue, and the space is fully accessible with elevators and ramps for participants with reduced mobility. Meals and snacks can be easily placed somewhere on the two adjacent floor. The Rotonde’s central location and adaptable layout make it an ideal space for hosting the competition and welcoming all attending teams.

# Campus + City - Are there hotels close to the University? Are there bars, restaurants or other interesting places nearby that could host one or many activities? How do you envision transport to the different point of interest? How accessible are those places?
Most hotels with sufficient capacity to host the CSGames are located in downtown Montréal, providing convenient access to a variety of bars, restaurants, and venues that could host different activities. The city’s extensive public transit system, particularly the subway, offers an efficient and eco-friendly way to travel between key locations. Additionally, most of these venues are easily accessible, ensuring a smooth experience for participants.

# Other facilities - Any other facility or asset(s) worth mentioning
Another option for the main hall is the atrium of the Lassonde pavilion, but the capacity isn't great enough for 30 teams.

As the director of the organisation, I have various responsibilities including overlooking all operations and represent all of the divisions at various school and corporate events. I am also the person in charge of the PolyHacks, which is an annually hosted programming competition at Polytechnique Montreal that has around 350 participants every year. Most of my job is taking care of the logistic, supervise the budget and  attend meetings with sponsors for partnerships. I've explored almost every facets of event organizing with this role. At the same time, since Febuary 2020 I've been a volunteer at CRC (Canadian Robotics Competition) and taking on the role of Team Lead in programming since 2023. In that role, I organize the programming competition within the robotics competition, lead the team that develop the programming problems and create educational content for the participants that are from high school and cegep level. I've been interested to organize the CSGames since I first participated in 2023. I believe that my experiences as an event organizer for the last few year can be greatly used to organize such a prestigious event. It would be the last  event I organize as a student and arguably the biggest yet. I think that my knowledge in event organization can really help to make the event flawless and have some, out of the ordinary, memorable moments.

Co-VP-logistic Clémentine Chailleux : software engineering at Polytechnique Montréal; Never participated; I will assist the president in managing various logistical aspects, acting as a second contact to ensure availability during parallel operations, such as overseeing hotel and competition venue arrivals. My previous experiences as VP-Integration for Polyparty and as a director for CEGInfo allowed me to develop essential leadership and problem-solving skills.

My responsibilities will include organizing the Sunday banquet and all evening activities, planning meals for participants from Friday night to Monday morning, booking venues like hotels, classrooms, and gym facilities, coordinating transportation, ordering participant merchandise, recruiting and training volunteers, and securing liability insurance.

Vice-President Zachary Ouellet; software engineering; 1 participation (2024) and maybe a 2nd this year; My role for the organisation will be to help the president with most aspects of the logistics organisation and be a second contact to offer more availability during split operations (like managing the hotel and competition venue arrivals). I am quit invested in the I spent 2 years leading different teams in the Exocet student project. Exocet is a group dedicated to design and build a hydrogen powered marine vehicle. I had to lead teams and make sure every project was on schedule for our competition. I also was responsible of managing crisis during these competitions. These leadership and quick thinking skills will be crucial to run the CSGames without any frustrating bumps or ridges for the participants.

# Is there anything you would change to this structure? - You would like to have a Vice-President, add another VP role, etc.? Please describe the modification you'd do and justify why it would help you, your team and your organization process. Remember that VPs are core members that needs to be present to meetings, will help you define the vision and will have a lot to say in the organization. Directors are people part of your VPs' team who helps out on the executive side of a big chunk of the tasks to be done. They usually don't take part in your organization's vision as much.
Due to the distance between the hotel and Poly, I would add a Vice-President to have an oversight on the hotel. Also, as François Tourigny will graduate before the CSGames 2026, but would be extremely helpful for Logistics, I want to introduce a Co-VP-logistics to assist the VP-Logistics and split the task.

# How would you improve the CS Games? - Taking your CSG experience into account, what already existing elements of the CS Games would you like to work on to make it better?
Building on my CS Games experience, I’d focus on enhancing the variety and structure of challenges to make them more interdisciplinary, pushing participants to adapt quickly to problems that span different areas, such as combining software and hardware. I’d also like competition with team algorithm competing against other team algorithm, forcing competitors to adapt on the fly as strategy evolve. This would make the competition both more challenging and unique, pushing participants to test their adaptability in multiple ways.

# What will differentiate your CS Games? - What new elements do you envision of bringing? What will be your edition's special sauce to make it unique through the history of the CS Games?
For this edition of the CS Games, my focus will be on reconnecting with American universities that participated before COVID, bringing back a larger, more diverse group of teams. This will not only increase the competition's reach but also raise the overall level of challenge.
